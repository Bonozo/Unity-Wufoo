# Unity-Wufoo
Wufoo API via Unity 5.6+


This was a failed attempt to use the Wufoo API from Unity.
Unable to login via Basic Auth.  The result is always
"The authentication or decryption has failed."

It may be because:
1) SSL issues with unity and/or the Wufoo server.
2) Unity uses dotNet 2.0, not 4.5

Perhaps the fix simple oversight, or a major code change, and/or an adjustment on the Wufoo server (which I feel is likely due to success of using SSL with other sites).

Looking for a solution!
